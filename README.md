## 🎨 How to Customize

### ▪ How to change the blog name

In `custom/profile.ts`, edit `blogTitle` as you want.

### ▪ How to update the user profile

Change `profileName`, `profileIntroduction`, and `profileGithubLink` in `custom/navigation.ts`. For the profile picture, replace `profile_pic.png` in the `custom/ folder` with your image (keeping the filename the same).

### ▪ How to change the logo

Replace `icon.png` in the `public/` folder with your logo image.

### ▪ How to change colors

Change the color values in `custom/colors.ts`. The blog’s primary colors are generally based on `primary[500]`.

### ▪ How to add categories

Add your categories as an array in `custom/category.ts`.

### ▪ How to update Markdown design

`src/post/MarkDownPost.tsx` applies styles to parsed markdown data converted to HTML. You can customize the blog post design here.

### ▪ More detailed customization

For more detailed customization beyond what’s described, explore the `src/` folder. Various components are in here, with comments added to most of the code. Feel free to edit.
